# Access & Permissions Dashboard

The Access & Permissions tab provides a consolidated view of who has access to what within your ThetaSecure environment.

**Navigation:** Dashboard → Access & Permissions tab

## Overview

This dashboard displays the relationship between users, roles, groups, and the applications or resources they can access. Use it to audit access assignments, identify over-permissioned accounts, and verify that access policies are correctly applied.

## Key Features

### User-Application Matrix

A matrix view showing which users have access to which applications, along with the method of access (direct assignment, group membership, or role inheritance).

### Role Hierarchy Viewer

Visualizes the role structure in your organization, showing parent-child relationships and inherited permissions.

### Group Membership Overview

Lists all groups with their member counts, associated roles, and application access.

## Common Use Cases

- **Access reviews**: Periodically verify that users have only the access they need
- **Onboarding verification**: Confirm new users have been assigned the correct groups and roles
- **Offboarding audits**: Ensure departed users have had all access revoked
- **Compliance reporting**: Generate evidence of access control for auditors
